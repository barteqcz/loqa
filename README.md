# Loqa

**Loqa** is a location-aware radio streaming application for Android that seamlessly switches between radio stations as you move. It ensures you always have the best local or network-affiliated station playing, no matter where your journey takes you.

## Features

- **Location-Based Discovery**: Automatically finds and lists radio stations near your current location.
- **Smart Station Handoff**: The core "Loqa" feature — the app monitors your location in the background and automatically switches to a nearby station or an affiliated network station if you move out of coverage.
- **Modern UI**: Built entirely with **Jetpack Compose**, featuring a sleek, dark-themed interface with **Material You** dynamic color support.
- **High-Quality Streaming**: Powered by **Android Media3 (ExoPlayer)**, supporting various formats including HLS and DASH.
- **Background Playback**: Full integration with Android Media Session, providing rich notifications and lock screen controls.
- **Smart Metadata**: Displays real-time song and artist information (E-RDS) where available.
- **Favorites**: Mark your favorite stations for quick access and priority in the handoff logic.
- **Seamless Fading**: Audio fades in and out during station transitions and when pausing/resuming for a premium listening experience.


> **Note**: This app requires Location permissions (including Background Location) to perform the automatic station switching feature.
